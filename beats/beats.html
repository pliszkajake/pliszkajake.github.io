  <p>
    I enjoy making beats in my free time. My preferred DAW (digital audio work station) is <a
    href="https://www.apple.com/ios/garageband/" alt="GarageBand for iOS link">GarageBand for iOS</a> (pictured
    below). While I am open to trying out new genres, I typically make beats within the contemporary hip-hop realm,
    spanning hip-hop subgenres such as <i>trap</i>, <i>drill</i>, and <i>pluggnb</i>. I started making beats in 2021
    after learning a few basics from the internet and continued to grow my skillset from there. I enjoy making beats as
    it is a fun creative outlet as well as a means of engaging with music from another angle as a creator.
