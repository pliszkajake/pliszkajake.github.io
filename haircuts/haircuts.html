  <p>
    I enjoy giving haircuts to my friends, family, and peers. While I am <em>NOT</em> a professional barber and do not
    advertise myself as such, I find joy in helping others look fresh with the skills I have acquired from internet
    tutorials in addition to an abundance of trial-and-error experience. I have improved significantly since
    starting in 2022, continuing to deliver whenever anyone needs help cleaning up their hairstyle.

    Some examples of haircuts I have given others include...
